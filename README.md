# Word Puzzle
#### Course: Java
#### Week 1 code review, Feb 12 2016

## A word puzzle program
#### The user inputs a sentence or phrase and the program removes the vowels and displays the altered sentence or phrase on a new page.  There is then an input field that someone can use to try and correctly guess what the sentence/phrase initially said.

## To set up, clone the repository to your local hard drive.  Navigate to the root directory wordPuzzleJava in your terminal.  Run gradle in your terminal by typing: gradle run.  This should ignite the spark webserver.  You can now open up a web browser and go to "http://localhost:4567/" to play the word puzzle game.
